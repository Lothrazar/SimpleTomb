# Open Source information

# This mod is not meant to replace corail tombstone, and it is not a faithful recreation of the original.  This is a different mod with elements of the original, and re-using some of the original mods code under the license.  

# The modid is 'simpletomb' matching the config file.
The Tombstones mod has been historically closed source. The original author (Corail) made a certain specific version of the mod open source under LGPLv2.1, and this uses some shared code of that version, which used to be hosted  [here](https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Corail-Tombstone)
