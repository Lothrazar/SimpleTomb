# Simple Tombs


A Forge mod for Minecraft Java.  This mod adds one unobtainable tombstone block that is used to hold the players items on death.  You get a key to help you locate your grave (can teleport to it in creative).  This is a modified fork of Corail's Tombstone with most content removed, other features changed and some added.
